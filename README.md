This is a basic game written in haskell. 
This started out as me going through [Game Programming in Haskell](https://leanpub.com/gameinhaskell)
and will evolve into something of my own (I hope).
The main reasons for writing this are to have some fun by
writing games and to learn more about FRP.

## Dependencies
* OpenGL
* GLFW
* FTGL

## Running the Game
Just download the source code, build it with cabal or ghc,
and run the executable.

Note: For reasons unknown to me, using `cabal run` or `runhaskell`
will not work.
